The code and data in this depository complement the paper "Assimilating Satellite Snow Depth Observations over the Indus Basin Mountain Ranges". Code used to run the particle batch smoother and to generate the synthetic satellite observations are included here, along with Noah-MP LIS configuration files and model and data assimilation output.
