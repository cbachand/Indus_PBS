To run the GEOSldas model, you can refer to this github: https://github.com/GEOS-ESM/GEOSldas. 

Using this model requires access to forcing data and land boundary conditions that I have access to on the NASA super computer. 
I will provide files necessary to run the model here (or at least the ones I can), and I will also share my model run results in this folder.
